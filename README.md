# EDA and prediction on Mental Health in Tech Survey



## About the Project
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a mental health survey dataset from the tech industry. It examines factors such as age, gender, family history, and workplace environment to identify patterns in mental health treatment-seeking behavior. The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, visualizations of key trends, and feature engineering. A Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict treatment-seeking behavior, achieving approximately 66% accuracy. Insights reveal correlations between work interference, benefits availability, and treatment outcomes, aiming to inform workplace mental health policies.

## How to Use

## How to Access the Project
1. Ensure Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab is installed (via Anaconda or `pip install notebook`).
2. Clone or download the project folder from GitHub.
3. Navigate to the folder in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run `jupyter notebook` to launch the Jupyter server.
5. Open `model.ipynb` in the browser interface.
Alternatively, upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Colab (colab.research.google.com) for online execution. Ensure `survey.csv` is in the same directory or uploaded to Colab to load the data correctly.
